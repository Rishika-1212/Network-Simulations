## 🔧 How It Works
1. 🖥 Users select a network simulation model.
2. 🔄 Data packets are transmitted across simulated network nodes.
3. 📡 The system visualizes the flow of data over the network.
4. 📊 Users analyze network performance and efficiency.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 **Support for more network protocols** (TCP, UDP, etc.).
- 🔗 **Integration with real-world networking APIs**.
- 📊 **Performance analysis tools** to measure latency and bandwidth.
- 🖧 **Multi-user simulations** to enhance interactivity.
- 🎯 **AI-based network optimization suggestions**.
